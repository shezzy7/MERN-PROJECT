Express session is a npm package which helps in creating a session info on server and storing sessions info in our browser.
For example if we go on a e-commerce website and visit electronics section and there we added some items in our cart and then we move to another section lets support watches collection.So as we know that we have not fialised our order of items selected from electronics so still we cannot store their info in our databases as we use databases for info that we want to store permanently.But this info is still temporary and as we move from one page to other we need to store this info in a temporary storage.So for this purpose we use 'express-session' they help us in saving this info in a temporary storage, many types temporary storages are available in the markete, and stores the id of this info to browser in the form of cookies.We don't send all the info of a session to cookies because our cookies can store a little amount of data and also are less secure.
